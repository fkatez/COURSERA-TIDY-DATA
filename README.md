CodeBook.md describes how to use all the variables, data, and any relevant transformations or work that was conducted to clean up the data to make it ready for further analysis.

run_analysis.R is the main R-code that performs the analyses described in the 5 steps documented in the homework assignement. Anyone can launch this R-code in RStudio by simply importing it and pointing to the relevant directories with the data etc... 

The output of the 5th step is a text file called "secTidySet.txt", and already uploaded in the course's project's form.
